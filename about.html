    <h3>Background and Experience</h3>
    <p class="background">
        I am from and currently located in Janesville, Wisconsin. Some of the organizations I am involved in at Craig
        High School include Chamber Orchestra (3 years), Tri-M (music honors society, 2 years), French club (2 years), National
        French Honors Society (2 years), and National Art Honors Society (1 year). I haev amassed numerous hours of volunteer work
        through these programs and will continue to do so through the end of my senior year. Some of my work experience
        includes working at Mac's Pizza Shack as a busser (July - October 2023) and working at Goodwill as a cashier (October 2023 - present).

    <p id="interests">Hi, I'm Lidia! I am currently an 18 year old senior at Craig High School. Some of my hobbis include drawing, jewelry making, 
        playing the violin, and I have very recently gotten into photography.My plans for after high school are to attend U.W. Whitewater 
        and major in psychology. As of right now, I am hoping to become a school counselor or school pyschologist.
        <br><br>
        Although I am going to school of psychology, I have been taking a computer programming and web design class since the beginning 
        of this school year, which has sparked an interest in web design in me. I can provide services such as software and web development. 
        If you are interested in these services or would like to know more about me, please contact me through my social media 
        pages or the form below!

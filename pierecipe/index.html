    <h2>Grandma's Life</h2>
    <p>Grandma is a world class baker and cook. She's travelled around the world to share the joy
        of cooking and now she has her very own website to share all of her homemade recipes with you!
        Grandma may be an internet sensation now, but she didnt start out that way. She was born on June 16th, 1942
        on a quaint little dairy farm nestled in a the rolling hills of Tennessee. Her real name is Evelyn Jones. She took special interest to the kitchen from a young age. She recalls in 
        a 1989 interview that she loved the smells that would waft into her and her 9 siblings shared bedroom
        when her mother would make them breakfast. She would eventually come to help her mother out
        in their tiny farmhouse kitchen, turning the fresh milk from their farm into delicous baked goods. As 
        she grew older, her skills in the kitchen blossomed. She attended college, but found herself to be 
        creatively challenged. To relieve this feeling, she would bake. She dropped out of college after two years and 
        never looked back, opening her own bakery shortly after. The bakery soon became a hit with locals, and 
        eventually people began to travel far and wide for a taste of Grandma's delectible breads and pasties. Her 
        fame grew so wide that she was able to open three more bakeries and two restaurants in only the span of four years!
        Grandma now owns restaurants and bakeries all over the country, but continues to be modest and warm-hearted, 
        continuing to bake with the same passion that was ignited in her as a girl.

    <h2>Grandma's Life</h2>
    <p>Grandma is a world class baker and cook. She's travelled around the world to share the joy
        of cooking and now she has her very own website to share all of her homemade recipes with you!
        Grandma may be an internet sensation now, but she didnt start out that way. She was born on June 16th, 1942
        on a humble dairy farm nestled in a picturesque valley. Her real name is Evelyn Jones. She took special interest to the kitchen from a young age. She recalls in 
        a 1989 interview that she loved the smells that would waft into her and her 9 siblings shared bedroom
        when her mother would make them breakfast. She would eventually come to help her mother out
        in their tiny farmhouse kitchen, turning the fresh milk from their farm into delicous baked goods.
